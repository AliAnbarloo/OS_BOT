# os_bot
This is a simple robot (maybe it can't even be called a robot) to show the contents of a **folder** along with its files and you can **search** in your chosen folder.
---
## Commands
The only available commands are **exit** and **cls**.
In most cases, you have to enter the address of your folder, then a list of the contents of the folder will be displayed. If you want to know if there is a file at the address you gave, we will be asked and you will find the answer.
